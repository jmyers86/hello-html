    <p>
      Born in 1928 in Japan, Tezuka was a pioneer in cartooning. 
      Often called "The God of Manga" Tezuka was heavily inspired by American cartoons of the 1940's. He has created many seminal works in the sequential art world 
      and is credited with blending eastern and western styles to form some of the earliest examples of modern manga. Notable works are Astro Boy, Dororo and Black Jack.
